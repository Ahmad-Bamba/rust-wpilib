# Rust WPILib [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KyleStach1678/rust-wpilib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KyleStach1678/rust-wpilib)

rust-wpilib is an equivalent to [WPILib](https://www.github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib), rewritten in Rust. The goal of
this project is to create a lightweight alternative to WPILib for FIRST Robotics Competition teams who would prefer to
use the language for its safety guarantees.
